# Overview
This repository contains my Master thesis project on "Recent Approaches to Instrumental Variables Estimation for Causal Inference". It contains the pdf and also the code used for simulations. We compare both theoretically and with simulations some of the main algorithm using instrumental variables such as two-stage least squares, DeepIV, DeepGMM, control function, DeepCF and general control function. We propose an algorithm that uses the principles of control function with neural networks, we call it DeepCF.

# Installation

To run the code in this repository DeepIV (https://github.com/py-why/EconML), DeepGMM (https://github.com/CausalML/DeepGMM) and GCFN (https://github.com/rajesh-lab/gcfn-code) needs to be uplaoded as well as the main library such as keras, tensorflow, numpy.

# Usage

The pdf of the master's thesis can be found in the section "paper". The algorithms 2SLS, CF, DeepCF and GCFN can be found in the folder "estimators" and can be run independently. The plots in the section "simulation" of the paper can be found in the folder "simulation". Some simulation might take several hours to compile, the settings can be change to make it shorter.
